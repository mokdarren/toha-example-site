```yaml
baseURL: http://example.org/

    # a summary of what you do
    summary:

```

You can just copy the content for `config.yaml` files from `theme/toha/exampleSite/config.yaml`.

### Usage

Run your hugo site with this theme.

```console
hugo server -w
```

Don't panic if the generated site does not look like what have you seen in the demo. Now, you have to provide some data in `data` folder of your site.

Follow the posts giving step by step instructions for configuring your data folder from [here](https://toha.netlify.app/posts/configuration/home-section/home-section/).

You can also follow the sample format given in `themes/toha/exampleSite/data/sections` directory.
